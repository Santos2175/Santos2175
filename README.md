## About Me
My journey into full-stack development started with a curiosity about how technology solves real-world problems. I quickly became fascinated with how data flows behind the scenesâ€”and that led me to building full web applications from scratch.

Now, I work with tools like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create clean, user-friendly solutions. I enjoy both designing interfaces and engineering the backend that powers them. I'm always eager to learn, take on meaningful challenges, and grow with teams building something impactful.
